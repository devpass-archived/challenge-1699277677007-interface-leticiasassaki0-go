## Interface Challenge
In this challenge, we are going to create an interface called `Shape` in Go. The interface should contain two methods, `Name()` and `Area()`, that return a string and a float64 respectively.

You need to create two structs, `Circle` and `Rectangle`, that implement the `Shape` interface. Each struct should have the necessary fields and methods to calculate the area of the circle and rectangle.

Finally, create instances of the `Circle` and `Rectangle` structs, add them to a slice of `Shape`, and print the name and area of each shape.
